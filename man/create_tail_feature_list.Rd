\title{Create list of poly(A) tail features from multi-Fast5 files}
\usage{
create_tail_feature_list(
  nanopolish,
  sequencing_summary,
  workspace,
  num_cores,
  basecall_group,
  pass_only = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{nanopolish}{Character string or data frame. Full path of the
\code{.tsv} file produced by nanopolish polya function, or an in-memory
data frame.}

\item{sequencing_summary}{Character string or data frame. Full path of the
\code{.txt} file with sequencing summary, or an in-memory data frame.}

\item{workspace}{Character string. Full path of the directory containing
the basecalled multi-Fast5 files.}

\item{num_cores}{Numeric. Number of physical cores to use in processing.
Do not exceed 1 less than the number of cores at your disposal.}

\item{basecall_group}{Character string. Name of the level in the Fast5
file hierarchy from which data should be extracted (e.g.,
\code{"Basecall_1D_000"}).}

\item{pass_only}{Logical. If \code{TRUE} (default), only reads tagged by
nanopolish as \code{"PASS"} are taken into consideration. If \code{FALSE},
reads tagged as \code{"PASS"} and \code{"SUFFCLIP"} are both included.}
}
\value{
A named list with three elements:
  \describe{
    \item{tail_feature_list}{Named list of per-read tail features. Each
      element contains \code{fast5_filename}, \code{tail_signal},
      \code{tail_moves}, and \code{tail_pseudomoves} (see
      \code{\link{extract_tail_data}}).}
    \item{zeromoved_readnames}{Character vector. Read IDs discarded because
      all basecaller moves in their tail region were zero.}
    \item{nonpseudomoved_readnames}{Character vector. Read IDs discarded
      because their pseudomove chain was too short (< 5 consecutive
      positions) to indicate a potential modification.}
  }
  Always assign the returned list to a variable. Printing the full output
  to the console may crash your R session.
}
\description{
Extracts tail features of RNA reads from multi-Fast5 files basecalled by
Guppy and poly(A) tail characteristics (coordinates) produced by nanopolish
polya function. Processing is parallelized across reads using
\pkg{foreach} and \pkg{doSNOW}. A progress bar is displayed during
extraction.
}
\details{
After extraction, reads with zero-moved tails and reads that do not satisfy
the pseudomove condition (minimum run length of 5) are filtered out and
their identifiers are stored separately for downstream classification.
