\title{Substitute short zero-gaps surrounded by nonzero pseudomoves}
\usage{
substitute_gaps(pseudomoves)
}
\arguments{
\item{pseudomoves}{Numeric vector. Pseudomove vector produced by the
z-score filtering algorithm
(\code{\link{filter_signal_by_threshold}}), corresponding to the tail
region of the read of interest as delimited by nanopolish polya function.}
}
\value{
Numeric vector. Adjusted pseudomoves with short gaps filled.
}
\description{
Smooths the pseudomove vector by filling in isolated zero-gaps (length < 2)
flanked by identical nonzero values. This avoids redundancy introduced by
the z-score thresholding algorithm when the signal is jagged, so a single
modification region is reported instead of multiple fragmented segments.
