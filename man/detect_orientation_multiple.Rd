\title{Classify multiple cDNA read orientations using Dorado-style poly tail detection}
\usage{
detect_orientation_multiple(sequence_files, num_cores = 1, cli_log = message)
}
\arguments{
\item{sequence_files}{Character vector. Paths to sequence files (TSV format)
containing read_id and sequence columns.}

\item{num_cores}{Integer. Number of CPU cores to use for parallel processing.}

\item{cli_log}{Function for logging messages and progress.}
}
\value{
Data frame/tibble containing all sequences with added tail_type column
("polyA", "polyT", or "unidentified") based on Dorado-style edit distance matching
of SSP and VNP primers with score and separation validation.
The tail_type column is also written back to the original sequence files for persistence.
}
\description{
This function analyzes Nanopore cDNA sequences using the Dorado-style approach
for poly tail type detection. It uses edit distance-based matching of SSP and VNP
primer sequences at both ends of reads, testing forward and reverse orientations
to determine if reads contain poly(A) or poly(T) tails. The method uses sliding
window matching and requires both score and separation thresholds to be met.
The tail_type column is added to original sequence files and all sequences
are returned as a single tibble.
