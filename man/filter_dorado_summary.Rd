\title{Filter Dorado summary file for reads fulfilling ninetails qualit criteria}
\usage{
filter_dorado_summary(dorado_summary)
}
\arguments{
\item{dorado_summary}{Character path to a Dorado summary file (tab-delimited),
or a data frame containing summary information.}
}
\value{
A filtered tibble or data frame containing only reads that meet
the filtering criteria.

\description{
This function takes a Dorado summary file (from ONT Dorado basecaller)
or a data frame containing equivalent summary information,
and filters out reads that do not meet ninetails quality and alignment criteria.
Specifically, it removes reads with missing alignments, low mapping quality,
poly(A) start positions indicating most likely artifacts,
or poly(A) tails shorter than 10 bases.
}

\dontrun{
# From file
filtered <- filter_dorado_summary("dorado_summary.txt")

# From data frame
df <- data.frame(
  read_id = c("read1", "read2"),
  alignment_direction = c("+", "*"),
  alignment_mapq = c(60, 0),
  poly_tail_start = c(100, 0),
  poly_tail_length = c(20, 5)
)
filtered <- filter_dorado_summary(df)
