\title{Process and optionally split dorado summary file}
\usage{
process_dorado_summary(dorado_summary, save_dir, part_size, cli_log)
}
\arguments{
\item{dorado_summary}{character string or data.frame. Either full path of the .txt file
with dorado summary or an in-memory data.frame containing dorado summary data.}

\item{save_dir}{character string. Full path of the directory where the processed
files should be stored.}

\item{part_size}{numeric [100000] (optional). If provided, defines maximum
number of reads per output part.}

\item{cli_log}{Function for logging. This function is encoded in main
pipeline wrapper. Its purpose is to provide neatly formatted & informative log file.}
}
\value{
A character vector containing paths to the generated files.
}
\description{
This function processes a dorado alignment summary file. If the file contains more
reads than the specified part_size, it splits it into multiple smaller files.
Otherwise, it creates a copy in the summary directory. All files are saved in
'dorado_summary_dir' within the specified save directory.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
1. Validates input parameters and checks file existence
2. Reads the summary file if provided as path, or uses the provided data frame
3. Determines the number of parts needed based on total reads and part_size
4. Creates output files with naming pattern: original_filename_partn.txt
5. Splits and saves the data maintaining the original format

If input is a data frame, uses "summary" as the default prefix for output files.

The 'dorado_summary_dir' folder structure:
- If input size <= part_size: Contains a single file named 'dorado_summary.txt'
- If input size > part_size: Contains multiple files named 'part_XX.txt' where XX
  is a zero-padded number indicating the part number

 Important notes:
- Output files are tab-separated text files
- The original file name (without extension) is used as prefix for part files
- Directory structure will be created if it doesn't exist
