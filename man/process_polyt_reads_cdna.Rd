\title{Process polyT reads using ninetails pipeline}
\usage{
process_polyt_reads_cdna(
  polyt_sequences,
  signal_files,
  num_cores = 1,
  qc = TRUE,
  save_dir,
  prefix = "",
  cli_log = message
)
}
\arguments{
\item{polyt_sequences}{Data frame/tibble. PolyT-classified sequences with
read_id and tail_type columns.}

\item{signal_files}{Character vector. Paths to signal files containing
poly(A) tail signals extracted from POD5 files (will be filtered for polyT reads).}

\item{num_cores}{Integer. Number of CPU cores to use for parallel processing.}

\item{qc}{Logical. Whether to apply quality control filtering.}

\item{save_dir}{Character. Directory where processing results will be saved.}

\item{prefix}{Character. Optional prefix for output file names.}

\item{cli_log}{Function for logging messages and progress.}
}
\value{
List containing polyT processing results:
  \describe{
    \item{read_classes}{Data frame with read classification results (with tail_type preserved)}
    \item{nonadenosine_residues}{Data frame with predicted modifications (with tail_type preserved)}
    \item{processing_stats}{Summary statistics for polyT processing}
    \item{tail_type}{Character indicating this is "polyT" data}
  }
}
\description{
This function processes reads that have been classified as polyT-containing
through the cDNA classification pipeline. Updated to work with tibble input
instead of separate files. It applies the ninetails analysis pipeline to
identify non-thymidine residues within polyT tails. Currently uses the same
model as polyA processing until a polyT-specific model is trained.
