\title{Create list of poly(A) tail chunks centered on significant signal deviations}
\usage{
create_tail_chunk_list(tail_feature_list, num_cores)
}
\arguments{
\item{tail_feature_list}{List object produced by
\code{\link{create_tail_feature_list}}.}

\item{num_cores}{Numeric. Number of physical cores to use in processing.
Do not exceed 1 less than the number of cores at your disposal.}
}
\value{
A nested list containing the segmented tail data (chunks and
  coordinates) organized by read IDs. Each read entry contains one or more
  fragments, where each fragment is a list with:
  \describe{
    \item{chunk_sequence}{Numeric vector. Raw signal values (length 100)}
    \item{chunk_start_pos}{Integer. Starting index of the chunk in the
      original signal}
    \item{chunk_end_pos}{Integer. Ending index of the chunk in the
      original signal}
  }
}
\description{
Extracts fragments of poly(A) tails of ONT RNA reads potentially containing
non-A nucleotides, along with their coordinates, and appends the data to a
nested list organized by read IDs.
}
\details{
Parallelization is handled with \pkg{foreach} and \pkg{doSNOW}. A progress
bar is displayed during processing. After extraction, empty list elements
are pruned and chunk moves are dropped to minimize memory footprint.
