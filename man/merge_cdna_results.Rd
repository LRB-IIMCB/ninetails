\title{Merge polyA and polyT processing results for cDNA analysis}
\usage{
merge_cdna_results(
  polya_results = NULL,
  polyt_results = NULL,
  unidentified_files = character(0),
  save_dir,
  prefix = "",
  cli_log = message
)
}
\arguments{
\item{polya_results}{List. Results from polyA processing (from process_polya_reads_cdna).
Can be NULL if no polyA reads were found.}

\item{polyt_results}{List. Results from polyT processing (from process_polyt_reads_cdna).
Can be NULL if no polyT reads were found.}

\item{unidentified_files}{Character vector. Paths to files containing reads
that could not be classified as polyA or polyT.}

\item{save_dir}{Character. Directory where merged results will be saved.}

\item{prefix}{Character. Optional prefix for output file names.}

\item{cli_log}{Function for logging messages and progress.}
}
\value{
List containing merged cDNA results:
  \describe{
    \item{read_classes}{Data frame with all read classifications including tail_type}
    \item{nonadenosine_residues}{Data frame with all predicted modifications including tail_type}
    \item{processing_stats}{Combined summary statistics from both processing paths}
    \item{unidentified_stats}{Statistics for unidentified reads}
  }
}
\description{
This function combines the results from separate polyA and polyT processing
paths into a unified output. It merges read classifications, modification
predictions, and processing statistics while preserving tail type information.
It also handles unidentified reads that could not be classified.
