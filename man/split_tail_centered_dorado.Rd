\title{Extracts fragments of poly(A) tail signal (Dorado mode) containing potential modifications
along with their delimitation (positional indices; coordinates) within the tail.}
\usage{
split_tail_centered_dorado(readname, tail_feature_list)
}
\arguments{
\item{readname}{character string. Name of the given read within the
analyzed dataset.}

\item{tail_feature_list}{list object produced by
\code{\link{create_tail_features_list_dorado}} Dorado-tail feature
extraction function. Must contain
\code{$tail_signal} (numeric vector) and \code{$tail_pseudomoves} (integer vector)
for each read.}
}
\value{
a nested list where each element corresponds to a signal fragment.
Each fragment is itself a list with three entries:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{chunk_sequence}: numeric vector of raw signal values
    \item \code{chunk_start_pos}: integer, start index of the chunk
    \item \code{chunk_end_pos}: integer, end index of the chunk
  }
}
\description{
This function processes raw poly(A) tail signal and Dorado-derived pseudomoves
to identify and extract signal segments (chunks) potentially corresponding
to modified positions (e.g., non-A residues). Each extracted chunk spans
100 signal points, centered on the midpoint of a pseudomove run.
}
\details{
In the Dorado pipeline, moves are not used:
  * retrieving them from BAM files is computationally expensive
  * processing is non-intuitive

Instead, only pseudomoves are considered. As a safeguard against Dorado’s
tendency to extend poly(A) boundaries into the transcript body, the last
3 pseudomove values are forced to 0. This prevents misclassification of
transcript nucleotides as part of the tail.

Candidate modification regions are detected by:
  * run-length encoding (RLE) of the pseudomove vector
  * filtering runs of pseudomoves with length ≥ 5

Extracted fragments are padded/imputed if they extend beyond signal boundaries:
  * upstream/downstream missing values (NAs) are replaced
  * imputation is based on random draws from the 5 most frequent signal values

The function returns a list object (nested), where each element represents
one candidate modification region, containing:
  * `chunk_sequence`: the raw signal subsequence (length = 100, imputed if needed)
  * `chunk_start_pos`: starting index of the subsequence
  * `chunk_end_pos`: ending index of the subsequence
