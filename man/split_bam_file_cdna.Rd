\title{Split BAM file into parts based on read IDs from summary file}
\usage{
split_bam_file_cdna(
  bam_file,
  dorado_summary,
  part_size = 1e+05,
  save_dir,
  part_number,
  cli_log = message
)
}
\arguments{
\item{bam_file}{Character string. Path to input BAM file to be split.}

\item{dorado_summary}{Character string. Path to corresponding Dorado summary file
containing read IDs to include in this part.}

\item{part_size}{Integer. Target number of reads per output file part.}

\item{save_dir}{Character string. Directory where split BAM files will be saved.}

\item{part_number}{Integer. Part number for naming output files.}

\item{cli_log}{Function for logging messages and progress.}
}
\value{
Character vector of output BAM file paths created.
}
\description{
This function splits a large BAM file into smaller parts based on read IDs
from corresponding Dorado summary files. This is essential for memory management
when processing large cDNA datasets. The function filters the BAM file to include
only reads present in the summary file and creates appropriately sized output files.
