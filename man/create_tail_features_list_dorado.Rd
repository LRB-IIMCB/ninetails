\title{Creates a nested list of Dorado tail features (raw signal + pseudomoves).}
\usage{
create_tail_features_list_dorado(signal_list, num_cores)
}
\arguments{
\item{signal_list}{list of numeric vectors. Each element must represent
a raw poly(A) tail signal trace, with list names corresponding to read IDs.}

\item{num_cores}{numeric [1]. Number of physical cores to use in processing.
Do not exceed 1 less than the total available cores on your system.}
}
\value{
A nested list of tail features, organized by read IDs. Each read entry
contains:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{tail_signal}: numeric vector of the raw poly(A) tail signal.
    \item \code{tail_pseudomoves}: numeric vector of pseudomove states
          computed by \code{ninetails::filter_signal_by_threshold}.
  }
}
\description{
This function processes raw poly(A) tail signal traces from Dorado and computes
pseudomoves using a threshold-based filter. Each read is stored in a nested
list structure, keyed by its read ID, with both the raw signal and the
computed pseudomove vector.
}
\details{
Unlike Guppy-based pipelines, Dorado does not provide moves directly in BAM
files, so pseudomoves are computed empirically from the raw signal traces.

Parallel execution is handled with \pkg{foreach} and \pkg{doSNOW}, and a
progress bar is displayed during processing.
