\title{Count trailing occurrences of a character in a string}
\usage{
count_trailing_chars(string, char)
}
\arguments{
\item{string}{Character string. The sequence to analyze.}

\item{char}{Character string of length 1. The character to count at the
end of the string.}
}
\value{
Integer. Count of trailing character occurrences.
}
\description{
Counts how many times a specific character appears consecutively at the
end of a string, working backwards from the last character. Used
internally by the cDNA pipeline for poly(A)/poly(T) tail length
estimation from basecalled sequences.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{

count_trailing_chars("ACGTTTTT", "T")
# Returns 5

count_trailing_chars("ACGT", "A")
# Returns 0

}

are used for read orientation classification
