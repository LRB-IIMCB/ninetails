\title{Correct read class labels for backward compatibility}
\usage{
correct_labels(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Data frame. Ninetails read classification results
(\code{class_data}) or the output of \code{\link{merge_nonA_tables}}.
Must contain a \code{class} column.}
}
\value{
Data frame with corrected class labels in the \code{class} column.
}
\description{
Resolves naming convention changes between pre-release and current
versions of ninetails. Previously, read classes were labeled
\code{"modified"}, \code{"unmodified"}, and \code{"unclassified"}.
These have been changed to \code{"decorated"}, \code{"blank"}, and
\code{"unclassified"}, since the presence of non-A within a poly(A)
tail does not necessarily result from post-transcriptional modification;
it may be caused by semi-templated tails, polymerase slippage, or other
mechanisms.
