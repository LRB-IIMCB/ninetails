\title{Extract basecalled sequences from BAM file for cDNA analysis}
\usage{
extract_sequences_from_bam(bam_file, summary_file, cli_log = message)
}
\arguments{
\item{bam_file}{Character string. Path to BAM file containing basecalled sequences.}

\item{summary_file}{Character string. Path to corresponding Dorado summary file
containing read IDs to extract.}

\item{cli_log}{Function for logging messages and progress.}
}
\value{
Data frame with columns:
  \describe{
    \item{read_id}{Character. Read identifier}
    \item{sequence}{Character. Basecalled sequence}
    \item{sequence_length}{Integer. Length of the sequence}
    \item{mapping_quality}{Integer. Mapping quality score}
  }
}
\description{
This function extracts basecalled sequences from BAM files for reads that
are present in the corresponding Dorado summary file. It returns a data frame
with read IDs and their corresponding basecalled sequences, which can then
be used for orientation classification (polyA vs polyT) in the cDNA pipeline.
