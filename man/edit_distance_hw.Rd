\title{Calculate edit distance with sliding window (HW mode)}
\usage{
edit_distance_hw(query, target)
}
\arguments{
\item{query}{Character string. The primer or query sequence to search for.}

\item{target}{Character string. The target sequence window to search
within.}
}
\value{
Integer. The minimum Damerau–Levenshtein edit distance found across
  all possible sliding window alignments.
}
\description{
Computes the minimum edit distance between a query sequence and a target
sequence using a sliding window approach (HW: Hamming-like Window mode).
The query is aligned to all possible substrings of the target of equal
length, and the minimum distance across all alignments is returned.
}
\details{
Edit distance is computed using the Damerau–Levenshtein distance, as
implemented by \code{\link[utils]{adist}}, which accounts for insertions,
deletions, substitutions, and transpositions.

The sliding-window strategy for edit distance calculation is adapted from
approaches commonly used in natural language processing; see the reference
below for an illustrative example.

\examples{
\dontrun{

edit_distance_hw("ATCG", "XXATCGXX")
# Returns 0 (perfect match inside target)

edit_distance_hw("ATCG", "ATTT")
# Returns minimum distance across sliding windows
