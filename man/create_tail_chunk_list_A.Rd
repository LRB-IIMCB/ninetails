\name{create_tail_chunk_list_A}
\alias{create_tail_chunk_list_A}
\title{Creates list of tail chunks containing only A nucleotides.}
\usage{
create_tail_chunk_list_A(tail_feature_list, num_cores)
}
\arguments{
\item{tail_feature_list}{List object produced by
\code{\link{create_tail_feature_list_A}}.}

\item{num_cores}{Numeric \code{[1]}. Number of physical cores to use.
Do not exceed 1 less than the number of cores at your disposal.}
}
\value{
A named nested list organised by read IDs, where each element
  is a list of numeric vectors (each of length 100) representing the
  overlapping signal fragments.
}
\description{
Extracts overlapping fragments of poly(A) tail signals that do
\emph{not} contain non-A nucleotides and organises them in a nested
list keyed by read ID.
}
\details{
This training-set variant is designed for A-only reference data
preparation. Unlike \code{\link{create_tail_chunk_list_trainingset}}
(which centres chunks on modifications), this function uses
\code{\link{split_with_overlaps}} with \code{segment = 100} and
\code{overlap = 50}, effectively performing data augmentation by
producing overlapping windows across the entire tail signal.

create_tail_chunk_list_A(
  tail_feature_list = tail_feature_list,
  num_cores = 2)
