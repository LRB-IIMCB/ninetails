\alias{create_tail_chunk_list_dorado}
\title{Creates list of poly(A) tail chunks (Dorado mode) centered on significant signal deviations.}
\usage{
create_tail_chunk_list_dorado(tail_feature_list, num_cores)
}
\arguments{
\item{tail_feature_list}{list object produced by \code{\link{create_tail_feature_list}}
or an equivalent Dorado-tail feature extraction function. Must contain
per-read entries with \code{$tail_signal} and \code{$tail_pseudomoves}.}

\item{num_cores}{numeric [1]. Number of physical cores to use in processing.
Do not exceed 1 less than the number of available cores on your machine.}
}
\value{
A nested list containing the segmented tail data (chunks and coordinates),
organized by read IDs. Each read entry contains one or more fragments, where
each fragment is a list with:
  \itemize{
    \item \code{chunk_sequence}: numeric vector of raw signal values (length 100)
    \item \code{chunk_start_pos}: integer, starting index of the chunk
    \item \code{chunk_end_pos}: integer, ending index of the chunk
  }
}
\description{
Processes raw poly(A) tail signals and pseudomoves (as generated by Dorado)
in parallel to extract candidate signal fragments potentially containing
non-A nucleotides. Each fragment is 100 signal points long, centered on
pseudomove runs of sufficient length, and is returned with its positional
coordinates. The resulting data are organized into a nested list keyed
by read IDs.
}
\details{
This Dorado-specific function differs from the Guppy-based version:
  * moves are not used (to avoid costly BAM parsing and processing)
  * pseudomoves are corrected at the tail ends (last 3 values forced to 0)

Parallelization is handled with \pkg{foreach} and \pkg{doSNOW}, allowing
efficient scaling across multiple CPU cores. A progress bar is displayed
to monitor job completion.
