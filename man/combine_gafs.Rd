\title{Combine GASF and GADF into a two-channel array}
\usage{
combine_gafs(tail_chunk)
}
\arguments{
\item{tail_chunk}{Numeric vector. A 100-element signal chunk representing
a fragment of the poly(A) tail.}
}
\value{
An array of dimensions (100, 100, 2) where the first channel
  contains the GASF and the second channel contains the GADF, both
  produced by \code{\link{create_gaf}}.
}
\description{
Creates a two-dimensional array containing both the Gramian Angular
Summation Field (GASF) and the Gramian Angular Difference Field (GADF)
produced from a single ONT tail chunk. Using both representations
increases the sensitivity of the CNN classification by overcoming the
limitations of each method individually.
